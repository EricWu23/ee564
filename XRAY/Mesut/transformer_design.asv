%% Project-1: Transformer Design for X-Rays
%% Name: Mesut Uður
%% ID: 1626753
%% INTRODUCTION
% In this project, we are asked to design a high frequency, high voltage
% transformer for an X-Ray generator. X-ray devices are commonly used by
% radiographers
% to acquire an x-ray image of the inside of an object (as in medicine or
% non-destructive testing) but they are also used in sterilization or
% fluorescence [1]. An x-ray generator is composed of a main circuit and
% a filament circuit [2,3]. The main circuit is responsible for supplying
% power to the x-ray tube.
%%
% For the ionisation in the x-ray tube, high voltage is
% required. The voltage boost operation is achieved via a high frequency
% transformer (along with a DC/AC converter in the front and an AC/DC
% converter at the end). A high frequency transformer is preferred to
% reduce the size. In this project, design of a high frequency (100 kHz)
% transformer for a 30 kW X-ray generator is achieved.

Vpri_peak = Vin_peak*4/pi; % volts
Vpri_rms = Vpri_peak/sqrt(2); % volts
Vout_peak = 12500; % volts

%% CORE TYE AND MATERIAL SELECTION
% Usually, there are two types of transformers: Core type and Shell type.
% In high frequency applications as the flux is divided in the outer limbs
% so that core loss is reduced. Commonly double E (or EE) type cores are
% preferred. In this project, the first design is based on this type of
% cores.
%%
% As the core material, ferrite core is a common choice for high frequency
% applications, as they offer very low coercivity and hence hysteresis loss
% (and core loss) is low. Moreover, they do not need a laminated structure
% as their eddy current loss is relatively low [4].
%%
% For frequencies between 10 kHz and 3 MHz, manganeze-zinc ferrite cores
% are suggested whereas for
% frequencies between above 3 MHz, nickel-zinc ferrites are commonly used.
% The disadvantage of using a ferrite core is basically low saturation flux
% density (usually 500 mT max), however they offer a cheaper solution with
% relatively low core losses. Another candidate for a high frequency
% transformer is nanocrystalline core. They have high saturation flux
% density (usually above 2 Tesla), low core loss (comparable to ferrite
% cores). On the other hand, they are relatively expensive [5]. Properties of
% several cores are shown in the Figure below [6]:

I = imread('core_properties.png');
figure;
imshow(I);
title('Types of cores and their properties','FontSize',18,'FontWeight','Bold');

%%
% In this project, nickel-zinc ferrite core is selected from MAGNETICS with
% EE geometry [7]. U type cores are also included in the iterative core design
% procedure.

%%
% As the core material (apart from being ferrite), Magnetics
% offer several types [7,8]: J, W, F, L, P, R and T material. In common
% mode chokes, J and W materials are suggested whereas in power
% transformers for converters and inverters, F,L, P, R, T materials are
% suggested. The basic properties are higher permeability, lower loss at
% high temperatures etc. The P material is selected due to its higher
% permeability and higher saturation flux density.

%% OPERATING CONDITIONS
% First of all, the selectec core material has the following properties:
%%
% Inital permeability (relative): 2500
% Saturation flux density: 480 mT
% Curie temperature: 210 0C

%%
% The selected operating conditions are:
%%
% Efficiency at rated conditions: % 98
%%
% Operating maximum flux density: 0.3 Tesla
%%
% Operating frequency: 100 kHz
%%
% Fill factor (max): 0.5
%%
% Operating temperatýre (max): 60 0C

%% DESIGN PROCEDURE
% This part of the report describes how the design procedure is followed
% by using several different cores among which the most suitable will be
% selected.
%% Core Data-1
% The first set of the cores is composed of E cores data of which are shown
% below [7]:

core_weight = [49,52,87,60,114,164,57,103,212,255,179,135,410,495,250,357,980]; %grams

%% Number of Turns
% Calculation of number of turns from induced voltage
Npri = round(Vpri_rms./(4.44*frequency*flux));
Nsec = round(Vsec_rms./(4.44*frequency*flux));
%% Selection of wire
%%
% From the AWG wire table, the most suitable conductor is selected by the
% frequency limitation due to skin effect. The table is shown in the
% following figure [9].

% The selected conductor properties are given as folloing:

conductor_area = (conductor_diameter/2)^2*pi; % mm^2
ohms_per_km = 133.8568; % ohm/km
current_rating = 0.361; % Amps
%%
% By using the required current information, the required number of strands
% on each side are calculated by:
strand_primary = ceil(Ipri_rms/current_rating);
strand_secondary = ceil(Isec_rms/current_rating);
%% Fill Factor
% Fill factor is calculated without considering the insulation of wires
area_pri_winding = Npri*strand_primary*conductor_area; % mm^2
area_sec_winding = Nsec*strand_secondary*conductor_area; % mm^2
fill_factor = (area_pri_winding + area_sec_winding)./window_area;
%% Windings Resistances
% Mean length per turn is approximately calculated assuming the core is
% square shaped as:

% The total length and resiatance of each winding:

% Magnetics catalog as (P material @80 Cdegrees)[10]:

%%
% Core loss is calculated for the harmonic components up to 31st along with
% the fundamantal (100 kHz) component.
harmonic = 1:2:31;
total = numel(harmonic);
%%
% The RMS voltage at each harmonic component is calculated by using the
% harmonic spectrum of a square wave:
voltage_rms = (4/pi)*(1/sqrt(2))*Vin_peak./harmonic;
%%
% For each core in the set, each harmonic component of core loss is
% calculated and then summed. Flux density is found by using the RMS
% voltage and turn number information.
core_harmonic_loss = zeros(elements,total);
core_loss = zeros(1,elements);
for l = 1:elements
    for k = 1:total
        flux_density_harmonic = voltage_rms(k)/(4.44*Npri(l)*frequency*harmonic(k)*core_area(l)/1e6);
        PL_h = a*(f*harmonic(k))^c*(flux_density_harmonic*10)^d;
        core_harmonic_loss(l,k) = PL_h*core_volume(l)/1e6;
    end
    core_loss(1,l) = sum(core_harmonic_loss(l,:));

%% Observations From the Results of the 1st Core Set (EE)
%%
% First of all, a fill factor above 50% is not feasible since the
% insulation of wires have not been considered yet. This requires
% relatively low number of turns and wider core window. In other words, a
% core with a larger area and window area at the same time. Among the
% alternatives, 16th and 17th cores are suitable. In terms of efficiency,
% the selected 98% limit is obtained for cores 9th to 17th among which 13th
% and 14th has the best performance. However, efficiency is not as an
% important constraint as fill factor as the transformer is to be operated
% in short times, core number 17 is selected among the first set.

% amount of copper to be used is also tried to be minimized. When EE cores
% and U cores are compared, it is also observed that similar performance is
% obtained with less amount of core material (core mass) with double E
% cores. Transformer cost is therefore minimized in terms of both copper
% and core.

% The leakage inductance is highly dependent to the winding geometry and

% The parasitic capacitances should also be taken into account for high

% normal frequency, these capacitive components which occur between
% turns, windings, insulation etc. do not have that much of effect; however, as the
% frequency increases, the impedance decreases and the leakage currents
% start to emerge. One other effect of these capacitances are spikes on the
% current with high frequency square wave operation. Premature resonance
% and electrostatic coupling with other circuits are also some adverse
% effects. there are some methods which are based on some tests and
% empirical formulas to determine the leakage capacitances [16]. In the scope
% of this work, equivalent capacitance calculation is not included.
%%
% Another important effect for wire selection, proximity effect should also
% be considered for high frequency transformer design. Proximity effect can
% be defined as the emergence of eddy currents on nearby conductors when
% severals strans of conductors (as in this design) carry the same current
% at high frequencies resulting in an increase on the wire resistances. It
% can be eliminated by conductor bundling as the direction of magnetic
% fields is reversed throughout the winding and the net effect is near
% zero. Litz wires can be used to deal with the proximity effect as shown
% in the Figure.

%% CONCLUSIONS
%%
% In this project, a high frequency, high voltage transformer is designed
% for an X-ray generator application. High frequency transformers in power
% electronics converters offer a significant reduction on the size of the
% converter; on the other hand, they need more attention than the classical
% low frequency transformers as parasitic effects start to emerge, core
% losses (both eddy current and hysteresis) start to increase, copper
% losses tend to increase due to skin and proximity effects, parasitic
% (leakage) inductances and capacitances become more crucial.
%%
% Core materials such as ferrites, amorphous and nanocrystalline have been
% suggested and used in high frequency magnetics designs. In this roject,
% ferrite core is selected for its relatively low core losses and low cost
% although they have a smaller saturation flux density.
%% 
% A design procedure
% is suggested in which, by using the design specifications and selected
% core data, required number of turns on both sides, resultant fill factor,
% winding resiatances, copper, core and total losses and efficiency are
% determined. This design procedure is applied to two different sets of
% cores (one with EE type and one with U type) and they are compared in
% terms of several constraints. To eliminate the skin effect, AWG#26 wire
% is selected to be used with several strands in parallel to carry the
% rated currents of the transformer.  
%%
% After the selection of the core material, type, dimensions etc which
% belongs to the Magnetics Inc., the actual design is achieved with the
% calculation of finalised parameters listed above. For the high voltage
% side which has a high number of turns, an iterative deisgn to determine
% the most suitable number of layers which turned out to be 6. A winding
% geometry is proposed to minimize the leakage inductances.
%%
% Finally, equivalent circuit parameters of the designed transformer are
% calculated including resistances representing copper losses and core
% loss, leakage inductances on
