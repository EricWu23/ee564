         <h2>Conclusion<a name="88"></a></h2>
         <p>Transformer can be designed in different ways to satisfy design requirements. In this design it is assumed that transformer
            is not used heavily thus it is focused on minimizing production cost. First core type is selected. U type P material core
            is assumed to be used in this design. After calculating skin depth at 100kHz, foil coil is decided to be used instead of using
            wires in paralel. Some assumptions such as maximum flux density and current density in wires are done. With these assumptions,
            core area is swept to observe where minimum cost occurs. The results in this report are calculated with respect to minimum
            cost. xraytrafoopt.m also generates loss versus core area graph thus design values for highest efficiency can also be calculated.
            By this project, it is concluded that transformer design requires optimization and there is not unique solution.

%% Conclusion
% Transformer can be designed in different ways to satisfy design
% requirements. In this design it is assumed that transformer is not used
% heavily thus it is focused on minimizing production cost. 
% First core type is selected. U type P material core is assumed to 
% be used in this design. After calculating skin depth at 100kHz, foil coil
% is decided to be used instead of using wires in paralel. Some assumptions
% such as maximum flux density and current density in wires are done. With
% these assumptions, core area is swept to observe where minimum cost
% occurs. The results in this report are calculated with respect to minimum
% cost. xraytrafoopt.m also generates loss versus core area graph thus 
% design values for highest efficiency can also be calculated. By this
% project, it is concluded that transformer design requires optimization
% and there is not unique solution.
