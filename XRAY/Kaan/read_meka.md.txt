Core material is selected.

Problems over Matlab-publishing path are removed.

Operation point of flux density studies are ongoing. An optimization structure will be considered and applied to have less core loss.

Lagrange polynomial method is used to complete T material's flux density vs core loss graphic's missing points. Flux density operation point is selected by amateur optimization and size consideration.

Wire size, paralleling requirementare decided. Considering different types of geometries and corresponding number of turns geometry type is decided for the best efficiency.
