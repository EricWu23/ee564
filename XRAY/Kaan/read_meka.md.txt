Core material is selected.

Problems over Matlab-publishing path are removed.

Operation point of flux density studies are ongoing. An optimization structure will be considered and applied to have less core loss.

Lagrange polynomial method is used to complete T material's flux density vs core loss graphic's missing points. Flux density operation point is selected by amateur optimization and size consideration.

Wire size, paralleling requirementare decided. Considering different types of geometries and corresponding number of turns, geometry type is decided for the best efficiency.

For this core and other all known parameters, losses, efficiency, mass, cost and electrical parameters are calculated.

Concluion is written and some updates are made to the rest of report. There might be still some upragreds but perhaps it is finished.
