%% Choosing Initial Material

%%
% First step of transformer design is selecting an appropriate core
% material. After some researches on internet and company application 
% guides, it is decided to use a ferrite material for XRAY transformer 
% application at 100kHz switching frequency.
%  
% After this decision, Magnetics' ferrite catalog is read and different
% types of materials are compared. In that comprasion, power losses of
% materials at 25°C and 100kHz is used as basic elimination parameter and
% it is decided to use T material. It is possible to find its parametets
% below:
%
% <<Tmaterial.PNG>>

%% Choosing Operation Flux Density

%%
% For the second phase of design, it is going to be choosen operation flux
% density. T material's saturation flux density is 470mT for this project's
% defined temperature range. Our value should be smaller than saturation
% point. But how much? Let's consider over the formula below:
% 
% $e = -\frac{2*\pi}{\sqrt{2}}N2{\pi}fB_{peak}*A$
% 
% If only selectable parameters are considered, it is possible to see the
% trade-off between number of turns, flux density and area. Selecting high 
% number of turns come with dificulties of cabling and copper losses. Cable
% size is decided over current values so it is constant in this discussion.
% Area is important for transformer's size and weight values. It also
% effects cable length and core loss (over volume). Flux density is
% directly related with core losses. 
%  
% As B is increased, core loss is increased (nonlinearly). If we take BxA 
% value constant, then increasing B will decrease A and therefore volume 
% and weight will be less and it means less core loss. So here, by assuming 
% area and volume are proportional, an optimization will be made over core 
% loss.

B_opr = optimize_B(); %[T]
fprintf('The operation point of flux density is selected as %d mT.',B_opr*10^3)

%%
% Flux density vs core loss graphic has some missing points due to its
% nonlinearity. To be able to find required missing points Lagrange
% polynomial method is used (Function used in this project was written by 
% me during my 3rd class undergraduate studies). After completion is done, 
% assuming area effects volume proportionally, a basic multiplication is 
% made. In coreloss plot unit and magnitude aren't considered but result 
% shows how core loss changes as operation point of flux density is 
% increased. 
plot(B_req, Coreloss);
set(gca,'FontSize',12);
xlabel('Flux Density [mT]');
ylabel('Core loss [W]');
title('W_{Core loss} spread over B');
%%
% This plot shows us selecting an arbitrary operation point may result bad
% efficiecny. Selecting the 2nd minimum point 210mT may be an advantage to
% not have a bigger transformer and still have less core lose. But if the
% absolute minimum point is considered and 80mT is selected, than core loss
% will be 85% smaller. It may mean having 2.5 times bigger transformer but
% it is going to be possible to compansate this value by changing number of
% turns. Also here, it is needed to be asked: "Should it be really small?". 
% Perhaps this XRAY machine will be put in somewhere and stay there until 
% someone needs to clean under it. A small research is done about 
% "portable" XRAY machines. Here is the smallest result:
%
% <<Portable_XRAY1.PNG>>
%
% This XRAY machine is for dentists and just 60W. So our transformer is 
% used for something bigger:
%
% <<Portable_XRAY2.PNG>>
%
% This one's specs are given and when maximum points of voltage and current
% are multiplied result is 24kW and still smaller than our application. In
% such big machines, size of transformer may be ignored, its weight is also
% not so dominant. To be able to operate in a condition with less core loss 
% 80mT is selected as operation flux density. 

%% Determination of Core Dimensions & Number of turns

%%
% Independetly from core dimensions and number of turns, diameter of cable
% might be determined. Because of skin effect, ac current tends to flow on 
% the outside of a conductor.  On a wire the current density looks like a
% hollow tube.  Since the inside isn't used for AC current flow, it makes
% sense to eliminate as much of the hollow part as possible. 
%  
% Here is a practical AWG calculator : <http://daycounter.com/Calculators/SkinEffect/Skin-Effect-Calculator.phtml>
%  
% It suggests "AWG 25" for our application at 100 kHz but because it isn't
% so easy to find odd AWG numbered cables, AWG 24 will be used.

A_awg24 = 0.205*10^-6; %[m^2]
fprintf('Cross-section area of a AWG 24 wire is %0.3f mm^2.',A_awg24*10^6)

%%
% But how many parallel cables? For this purpose, Adiabatic equation will 
% be used. Detailed derivations about this process may be found at
% <http://www.openelectrical.org/wiki/index.php?title=Adiabatic_Short_Circuit_Temperature_Rise>
% The resultant formula is given below:
% 
% $A = \frac{\sqrt{{i^2}t}}{k}$
% 
% In this formula, A is the minimum cross-sectional area of conductor in
% $mm^2$ and k is the Adiabatic constant that might be calculated by 
% formula below.
% 
% $k = {\sqrt{\frac{{c_p}{\rho_d}{\delta}T}{\rho_r}}}$
% 
% Luckily, at the same website another formula is exist for Adiabatic 
% constant for only copper conductors:
% 
% $k = 226\sqrt{ln(1+\frac{T_f - T_i}{234.5 + T_i})}$
% 
% Here, only required part is initial and final temperatures. If we take
% initial value as 25 and let it rise 0.5 degrees,
% 
k_adb = 226*sqrt(log(1+(25.5-25)/(234.5+25)));
fprintf('than Adiabatic constant will be : %d',k_adb)
A_cbl_p = (sqrt((Ip_rms^2)*0.1)/k_adb)*(10^-6);
A_cbl_s = (sqrt((Is_rms^2)*0.1)/k_adb)*(10^-6);

%% 
% From calculated cross-section area of cable we understand that how many
% parallel cables need to be used for desired temperature rise:
% 
N_cbl_prl_p = ceil(A_cbl_p/A_awg24);
N_cbl_prl_s = ceil(A_cbl_s/A_awg24);

fprintf('%d parallel cables for primary and %d for secondary side will be OK.',N_cbl_prl_p,N_cbl_prl_s)

%% 
% Normally AWG 24 has much less current capability but for 100 miliseconds 
% of operation, it will be fine. 
%  
% Here, using induced voltage formula, it is needed to decide number of
% turns and core dimensions together considering the minimum loss. Core 
% material was already seleted as T material from Magnetics' ferrite 
% catalog. Following that decision and considering different types of 
% cores, 5 types of core geometries are selected as candidates. Best one 
% for total of copper and core losses will be selected as the final one. 
% Candidates are:
%  
% * OT44022EC
% * OT45724EC
% * OT45528EC 
% * OT45530EC 
% * OT46527EC

%%  
% Their cross-section and core volume, length of cable path and core-flux 
% path parameters are calculated and will be used for coreloss calculations.
% Volume and window areas are multiplied by 2 because it is planned to use 
% two cores as a couple without airgap. Also their window areas are 
% calculated to be able to see if we will be able to have enough space for 
% selected wires with selected number of turns.

%% Conclusion

%%
% During all design steps maximum efficiency is taken as main
% consideration. Operation flux density is selected for the least core loss
% point. Initial material is also selected because its low core loss
% coefficient property for operationg switching frequency and temperature.
% Skin effect limits the conductor's effective cross-sectional area so the
% most appropriate option is selected for the optimal result. After that
% selection, it is decided to how many conductors will be paralleled in
% both sides. Considering their temperature rise and conductor thicknisses
% these numbers are choosen. Next step was deciding core dimensions and 
% number of turns. At that point, considering core volume and corresponding
% core loss among with number of turns and copper losses the most optimum
% couple is selected. During this optimization it is also checked if window
% area of core is enough for this combination. Mass and cost are calculated
% and electical parameters are defined. There are missing parts and some
% assumptions throughout the design but efficiency is satisfaying.
