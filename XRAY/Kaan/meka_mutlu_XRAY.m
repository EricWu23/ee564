%% Choosing Initial Material

%%
% After some researches on internet and company application guides, it is
% decided to use a ferrite material for XRAY transformer application at
% 100kHz switching frequency.
% After this decision, Magnetics' ferrite catalog is read and different
% types of materials are compared. In that comprasion, power losses of
% materials at 25°C and 100kHz is used as basic elimination parameter and
% it is decided to use T material. It is possible to find its parametets
