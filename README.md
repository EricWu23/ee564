# EE564 Design Projects

## Guidelines

- Have look at the topics below. You can find detailed information and specs in the subfolders.

1. Tesla Model S Motor
2. BMW i3 Traction Motor
3. Tulomsas Train Traction Motor
4. Direct Drive PM Wind Turbine Generator Design


- Fill in your preference to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/173FqykIj7HfWxBJXid-JUIKdqOeXsMr1O3MJ19IN08g/edit?usp=sharing)

- Create an account in [GitHub](https://github.com/), and let me know your username, so I can give you write access to this repo.

- Learn how to use Git and GitHub, you can also download a software to make things easier ([Source Tree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is recommended). Have a look at [this link](http://ozan.keysan.me/okst/), for further tips.

- You are supposed to have all your text, codes and figures in the GitHub folder from the very first day (see Grading). First, create a sub-folder (named as your name) under the relevant topic folder. For example, `BMW->Ahmet`. Put all your files under this folder. You are encouraged to have a look at other people's work.

- Your reports has to be [reproducible](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261) (i.e. it has to include codes, equations and results). For text you can use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), just rename a text file as `.md` (this file itself is a markdown file).

-  However, if you want to include your calculations, I strongly suggest [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), which can be viewed [online](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/). You can also use Mathematica, [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) or Matlab Report Generator, but not Microsoft Word. If you are convinced to use IPython, here are some useful links:

  - To use it in your computer and for a quick start on Python install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads)
  - Or use [Wakari](https://wakari.io), or [Sage](http://sagemath.blogspot.com.tr/2013/09/ipython-notebooks-in-cloud-with.html) to use it online, or let me know, so I can give you  access to my personal server.
  - [IPhyton Notebook basics](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/pycon13_ipython.ipynb),  [Wakari IPython Basics](https://wakari.io/gallery)
  - [A gallery of interesting IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)

### What to Include

You should make a full design including (but not limited to) details such as :

- Main Dimensions (Outer diameter, air-gap diameter, axial-length, number of slots...). Some basic drawings would be perfect.
- Magnetic Circuit Details (flux density calculations at various points: air-gap, teeth, back-core etc, magnetic loading)
- Electric Circuit (Winding selection, electric loading, fill factor, phase resistance, winding factors (if applicable))
- Rough thermal calculations (cooling method, operating temperature, ways to improve cooling)
- Efficiency, current, torque calculations at various load conditions (full-load, half-load, no-load etc)
- Mass Calculations (structural mass, copper mass, steel mass, magnet mass etc)

You must use **at least one software tool** during your design process. Have a look at the [course web-page](http://ozan.keysan.me/ee564/) for some suggestions. Instead of using a software, you can link your analytical design with an optimization algorithm to choose best design parameters.

**Bonus:** Compare the effect of a design parameter on the overall design (i.e. different number of slots, different winding scheme, different aspect ratio etc).

### Grading

- **Number of Commits:30%**: The number of edits of your project  files as seen from the [contributors list](https://github.com/odtu/ee564/graphs/contributors). For example, if you make your project in the final days, you'll get no credit. The project topics are not easy, you are encouraged to start early and work regularly.

- **Level of Information:50%**: The detail level of your designs (see requirements above), and the accuracy of your calculations.

- **Report Quality:20%**: Text explaining your design decisions, quality of your figures, citing relevant studies and your conclusion section. 


### Deadline

**Final examination date: ~Early June**
