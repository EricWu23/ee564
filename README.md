## Guidelines for the Design Projects

- Deadline: Final examination date


### 1- Tesla Model S Motor
Design the induction motor that is used in [Tesla Model S](http://www.teslamotors.com/models), which has a few different variations. To keep things simple, use the [RWD 85 Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S#Powertrain), with rear wheel drive, which has the following specs:

- Max. Power: 360 hp (270 kW)
- Max. Torque: 441 Nm
- Top Speed: 225 km/h 

You can find some specs of the motor from [here](http://teslatap.com/undocumented/) and [here](http://my.teslamotors.com/it_IT/forum/forums/tesla-model-s-motor-output), you can find more information on the internet.

### 2- BMW i3 Traction Motor

[BMW i3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_i3) is a full-electric car, with a hybrid-synchronous motor. Although the motor is rated at 75 kW, it can produce instantaneous power up to 125 kW, and torque up to 250 Nm.

### 3- Tulomsas Train Traction Motor

[Tulomsas](http://www.tulomsas.com.tr) (Turkiye Lokomotif ve Motor Sanayi) manufactures a [few electric motors](http://www.tulomsas.com.tr/main.php?kid=198) for diesel and electric locomotives. Although most of them are DC motors, model [6FRA 3363](http://www.tulomsas.com.tr/main.php?kid=198) is an AC induction motor, with the following characteristics:

- Power: 150 kW
- Voltage: 800-1100 V
- Speed: 374- 3120 rpm
- Mass: 1560 kg

### 4- Direct-Drive PM Wind Turbine Generator Design

[The Switch](http://www.theswitch.com) is a PM generator manufacturer for wind turbines. They have models at [various rated speeds](http://www.theswitch.com/wind-power/permanent-magnet-generators/). You are supposed to design the smallest model of their direct-drive generators: [PMG1650](http://www.theswitch.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Datasheet_PMG1650-6300_EN_final-5.0_121214.pdf), with the following specifications:

- Rated Power: 1.65 MW
- Rated Speed: 17 rpm
- Rated Voltage: 690 V

The machine is forced-cooled, but you are free to design a natural-cooled machine (which will result in a larger machine but it's ok). You are also free to use any type of PM generator topology (radial flux, axial flux etc.), as long as you satisfy the operating conditions.
