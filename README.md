# EE564
Design Projects for EE564

## Guidelines for the Design Projects

- Have look at the topics below. You can find detailed information and specs in the folders.

1. Tesla Model S Motor
2. BMW i3 Traction Motor
3. Tulomsas Train Traction Motor
4. Direct-Drive PM Wind Turbine Generator Design

- Fill in your preference to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/173FqykIj7HfWxBJXid-JUIKdqOeXsMr1O3MJ19IN08g/edit?usp=sharing)

- Create an account in [GitHub](https://github.com/), and let me know your username, so I can give you write access on the repo.

- Learn how to use Git and GitHub, you can also download a software to make things easier ([Source Tree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is recommended). Have a look at [this link](http://ozan.keysan.me/okst/), for further tips.

- You are supposed to have all your text, codes and figures in the GitHub folder from the first day (see Grading). First create a sub-folder (your name) under the relevant topic folder. For example, BMW->Ahmet. Continue working on this folder. You are encouraged to have a look at other people's work.

- Your reports has to be [reproducible](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261) (i.e. it has to include codes, equations and results). For text you can use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), just rename a text file as `.md` (this file itself is a markdown file).

-  However, if you want to include your calculations, I strongly suggest [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), which can be viewed [online](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/). You can also use Mathematica, [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) or Matlab Report Generator, but not Microsoft Word. If you are convinced to use IPython, here are some useful links:

  - To use it in your computer and for a quick start on Python install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads)
  - Or use [Wakari](https://wakari.io), or [Sage](http://sagemath.blogspot.com.tr/2013/09/ipython-notebooks-in-cloud-with.html) to use it online, or let me know, so I can give you  access to my personal server.
  - [IPhyton Notebook basics](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/pycon13_ipython.ipynb),  [Wakari IPython Basics](https://wakari.io/gallery)
