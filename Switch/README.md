# Direct-Drive PM Wind Turbine Generator Design

[The Switch](http://www.theswitch.com) is a PM generator manufacturer for wind turbines. They have models at [various rated speeds](http://www.theswitch.com/wind-power/permanent-magnet-generators/). You are supposed to design the smallest model of their direct-drive generators: [PMG1650](http://www.theswitch.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Datasheet_PMG1650-6300_EN_final-5.0_121214.pdf), with the following specifications:

- Rated Power: 1.65 MW
- Rated Speed: 17 rpm
- Rated Voltage: 690 V

The machine is forced-cooled, but you are free to design a natural-cooled machine (which will result in a larger machine but it's ok). You are also free to use any type of PM generator topology (radial flux, axial flux etc.), as long as you satisfy the operating conditions.
