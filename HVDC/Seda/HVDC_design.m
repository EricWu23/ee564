%% HVDC Transformer Design
% Design a Transformer with the following specifications:
% 6.5 MVA, Single Phase
% 3 kV, 300 kV 
% 500 Hz
% Operating Temp: 110, Cooling: ONAN
% In this spec. commonly used oil type transformer
% Design Steps:
% Choose Initial Material,
% Choose Operating Flux Density,
% Determine Core Dimensions & Number of turns,
% Determine Core Losses and Copper Losses,
% Determine operating temp.
% Determine mass, cost etc.


%%  First Step: Choose Initial Material
% For the core material 0.23 mm M3 C type is choosen since losses should be low  when we consider high
% frequency , other material losses are very high.
