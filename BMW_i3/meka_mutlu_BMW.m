% In synchronous reluctance motor and induction motor comprasion it is 
% possible to say that for same power rating, size of synchronous 
% reluctance motor might be half of the induction machine. Instead rest of 
% the stator design is for induction motor but by taking same power rating, 
% our advantage will be better efficiecny.
%  
%% Main Dimensions of Stator Core

%%
% Boldea's The Induction Machine Handbook is going to be used to determine
% parameters and dimensions of motor. In Chapter 15, it is explained that
% $D_{is}^2L$ output constant concept will be used. For internal stator
% diameter formula below will be used:
%  
% $D_{is}^{3} = \frac{2pp_1S_{gap}}{\pi \lambda fC_0}$
%  
% To be able to calculate $D_{is}$, airgap power is needed.
Aimed_eff = 0.96;
Aimed_pf = 0.8;
fprintf('At this point targeted efficiency is taken as %2.0f %%.',Aimed_eff*100)
%% 
fprintf('Power factor is taken as %0.1f .',Aimed_pf)

%%
% Another required parameter to be able to calculate airgap power is Ke
% that is defined as E1 to Vin ratio in equation 14.8.
%  
% $K_E \approx 0.98 -0.005p_1$
%
Ke = 0.98- 0.005*p;

%%
% Now everything is ready for airgap apparent power:
%  
% $S_{gap} =\frac{K_EP_n}{\eta_ncos\Phi}$
% 
Sgap = Ke*Prated/(Aimed_eff*Aimed_pf);
fprintf('Airgap power is calculated as %3.1f KVA.',Sgap/1000)

%%
% After this calculation, missing parameters are stack aspect ratio and
% Esson's constant Co.
% Stack aspect ratio is selected from table below:
% 
% <<stack_aspect_ratio.PNG>>

stck_asp_ratio = 1.5;
fprintf('It is selected as %1.1f.',stck_asp_ratio)
%%
% Esson's constant is selected using Figure 14.14. 
% 
% <<Essons_constant.PNG>>
%  
% Because our calculated airgap power is out of figure's range it isn't 
% possible to read a certain value but for two pole-pairs after 60 kVA 
% Esson's constant starts to saturate and for our airgap apparent power 
% this value is taken as 240 J/dm^3.

Co=240*10^3; %[J/m^3]
%%
% Now we are ready to calculate internal stator diameter:

Dis = ((2*p*p*Sgap)/(pi*stck_asp_ratio*f_rated*Co))^(1/3);
fprintf('Internal diameter of stator is calculated as %2.3f cm.',Dis*100)
%% 
Dis = (ceil(Dis*1000))/1000;
fprintf('For realistic dimensions it is going to be taken as %2.1f cm.',Dis*100)
%%
% Now we can calculate stack length, deriving its formula from equation
% 15.2:
% 
% $L = \frac{\lambda \pi D_{is}}{2p}$

L = stck_asp_ratio*pi*Dis/(2*p);
fprintf('Stack length L is %2.2f cm.',L*100)
%%
L = (ceil(L*1000))/1000; %[m]
fprintf('For being realistic it is going to be taken as %2.1f cm.',L*100)
%%
% By using equation 14.14 it is possible to calculate the pole pitch:
%  
% $\tau = \frac{\pi D_{is}}{2p}$

pole_pitch = pi*Dis/(2*p); %[m]
fprintf('Pole pitch is %2.2f cm.',pole_pitch*100)
%%
% Next step is deciding external stator diameter. For its calculation,
% table below will be used.
% 
% <<Dout_ratio.PNG>>
% 
% It gives us information about ratio of internal and external stator
% diameters. For 4 poles this ratio will be taken as 0.61.

Kd = 0.61;
Dout = Dis / Kd;
fprintf('External diameter of stator is calculated as %2.3f cm.',Dout*100)

% SÝnce this value isn't good enough for a acceptable back-core flux
% density, 5 cm will is added to the calculated value.
%%
Dout = (ceil(Dout*1000))/1000+50*10^-3;
fprintf('For realistic dimensions it is going to be taken as %2.1f cm.',Dout*100)
%%
% For suitable airgap calculation book's equation of 14.38 may be used as
% well as the equation defined during the EE564 lecture of 6th April. Here
% it is important to remind that the minimum airgap is 0.2 mm.
%  
% Formula discussed in the lecture is as follows:
%  
% $airgap =0.18 + 0.006P^{0.4} mm$
%  
% Book equation of 14.38 is
%  
% $airgap =0.1+ 0.012P^{\frac{1}{3}} mm$
%  
% As known, too small airgap would produces large space airgap field
% harmonics and additional losses while a too large one would reduce the
% power factor and efficiency. Therefore, average of these two calculated
% airgap values will be used as actual airgap value.
g_lecture = (0.18 + 0.006*Prated^0.4)*10^-3;

%% The Stator Winding

%%
% Following James Hendershot's lecture notes, for 4 poles and 75 kW of
% rated power Stator slot number will be selected. Our rated power is
% nearly 67 HP and from table below, it is advised to choose 47 stator
% slots for our case.
%  
% <<Ns.PNG>>
%  
% Here we should remember that the total number of slots per stator should
% be divisible by the number of phases. So it should be a number that is
% multiple of 3.
%  
% $q = \frac{N_s}{2pm}$ 
%  
% If we think about its formula above (taken from book; 4.7), it is 
% possible to see that choosing Ns/m integer doesn't guarantee that q is 
% an integer. In fact it doesn't have to be an integer and may be selected 
% as a fraction. But in most induction machines, q is an integer to 
% provide complete (pole to pole) symmetry for the winding. So in our case 
% Ns must be multiple of 2pm=12. So Ns can be taken as 36. 
Ns = 36;
q = Ns/(2*p*m);
fprintf('Number of slots per pole per phase is %d .',q)
%%
% Now we should decide pitch factor. It can be selected as 5/6 to reduce
% 5th harmonic and reduce 7th harmonics. So two layered winding  with 
% chorded coils will be used.
pitch_factor = 5/6;
ang_pitch = pitch_factor*180; % [degree]
ang_pitch_rad = pitch_factor*pi; % [radian]
fprintf('Selected pitch angle is %d degree .',ang_pitch)
%%
% It is possible to calculate the electrical angle between emfs in 
% neighboring slots $\alpha_{ec}$
%  
% $\alpha_{ec}=\frac{2 \pi p}{N_s}$
ang_electrcl_rad = 2*pi*p/Ns;
ang_electrcl_deg = ang_electrcl_rad/pi*180;
fprintf('It is %0.3f radian means %d degree.',ang_electrcl_rad,ang_electrcl_deg)
%%
% Now we can calculate pitch factor. Due to chorded coils of stator,induced 
% voltage will drop but by means of harmonics we will have better results.
%  
% $k_p = sin(\frac{\lambda}{2})$
%  
kp = sin(ang_pitch_rad/2);
fprintf('Pitch factor is calculated as %0.2f .',kp)
%%
% Using formula below it is possible to calculate distribution factor.
%  
% $k_d = \frac{sin(q\frac{\alpha}{2})}{qsin\frac{\alpha}{2}}$
%  
kd = sin(q*ang_electrcl_rad/2)/(q*sin(ang_electrcl_rad/2));
fprintf('Distribution factor is calculated as %0.2f .',kd)

% Multiplicaiton of distribution and pitch factors are called as winding
% factor.
kw = kp * kd;
fprintf('Winding factor is calculated as %0.2f .',kw)
%%
% Using recommended intervals given in 15.11, it is possible to select the
% airgap flux density. For 4 poles suggested interval is 0.65 to 0.78
% Tesla. To decrease iron losses minimum of this interval will be taken as
% airgap flux density.
Bg = 0.65; %[T]
%%
% The pole coefficient $\alpha_i$ and form factor Kf depend on the tooth 
% saturation factor 1+Kst. If 1+Kst is taken as 1.4 than Kst is 0.4.
Kst = 0.4;

% Using this value and graph below, it is possible to select form factor
% and flux density shape factor.

% The number of per phase can be calculated using formula below given with
% (15.12).

% 
Nph = round(Ke*Vrms/(4*kf*kw*f_rated*pole_flux));

% The number of conductors per slot ns can be calculated using formula
% below:

% $n_s = \frac{a_1N_{ph}}{p_1q}$
%  
% Here a1 ise the number of current paths in parallel and will be taken as
% 1 for our case.
ns = Nph/(p*q);
fprintf('It is calculated as %1.2f .',ns)

% It should be an even number as there are two distinct coils per slot in a

%%
% If we turn back and recalculate the actual airgap flux density:
Bg = Bg*Nph/(ns*p*q);
fprintf('Recalculated airgap flux density is %1.3f T .',Bg)

% Now we can calculate rated current. 15.16 formula will be used:
%  
% $I_{in} = \frac{P_n}{\eta cos\phi_n \sqrt{3}V_1}$
Iin_rated = Prated/(Aimed_eff*Aimed_pf*sqrt(3)*Vrms);
fprintf('Rated phase current is calculated as %3.1f A .',Iin_rated)

fprintf('Insulated wire gauge diameter is %3.2f mm.',dco_ins*10^3)
%% Stator Slot Sizing

%% 
% Since we know wire diameter, number of conductors in parallel and number
% of turns per slot, it is possible for us to calculate the slot area. Only
% missing parameter is fill factor selection. For round wire and at our
% rated power level it is advised to be taken between 0.4 and 0.44. So it
% is selected as 0.44. For useful area calculation formula (15.21) will be
% used:
%  
% $A_{su} = \frac{\pi d_{co}^{2} a_p n_s}{4K_{fill}}$
%  
Kfill = 0.44;
A_slot = pi*(dco^2)*ap*ns/(4*Kfill); %[mm^2]
fprintf('Calculated useful slot area is %3.3f mm^2.',A_slot)

% There are two recommended stator slot shapes in the book as follows:
%  
% <<stator_slot_shape.PNG>>
%  
% For ease of calculation and to be able to use explained slot geometry,
% left-hand side of stator slot shape is selected.
%  
% For this shape, explained lengths and are as in the figure below:
%  
% <<selected_slot_shape.PNG>>
%  
% Here, some parameters will be selected via following books' suggestions
% and some of them will be calculated.
%  
% Suggested variables are bos, hos and hw. bos can be defined as slot

% Assuming that all the airgap flux passes through stator teeth:
% 
% $B_g \tau_s L \approx B_{ts} b_{ts} L K_{Fe}$
%%
% Here, Kfe is a constant to include lamination insulation's effect and 
% suggested to be defined as 0.96. It is suggested to have a tooth flux 
% density between 1.5 and 1.6 T. Let us take it as 1.6 T and determine bts:
Kfe = 0.96;
B_ts = 1.6;
%%
% Slot pitch isn't calculated yet, it is possible to use equation (15.3)
% for it.

fprintf('Recalculated tooth-flux density is %1.2f Tesla.',Bts)

% This value is nearly inside the suggested range so acceptable.
%  
% With the variables we know, using equation (15.23) it is possible to
% calculate the slot lower width:
%  
% $b_{s1} = \frac{\pi (D_{is} + 2h_{os} +2h_w)}{N_s} - b_{ts}$
%

%  
% $A_{su} = h_s\frac{b_{s1} + b_{s2}}{2}$
%  
% Also, we have(15.25) formula as follows:
%  
% $b_{s2} \approx b_{s1} +2h_stan\frac{\pi}{N_s}$
%  
% From these 2 equations;

% Now we can proceed in calculating mmf of airgap and teeth. The airgap mmf
% is:
%  
% $F_{mg} \approx K_c*g*\frac{B_g}{\mu_0}$
%  
% Here, Kc is the Carter's cofficient and it helps us to consider airgap
% surface as smooth and make our calculations directly. It is expected that 
% it is greater but close to 1; its formula is:
%  
% $K_c = \frac{\tau_s}{\tau_s-b_e}$
%  
% $b_e = Kb_{os}$
%  
% $K = \frac{\frac{b_{os}}{g}}{5 + \frac{b_{os}}{g}}$

F_mg = Kc*g*Bg/mu_0;
fprintf('The airgap mmf is %3.3f Aturns.',F_mg)

% Using tooth flux density and tooth's related heights we may calculate
% also mmf of stator tooth. Its formula is given with (15.30) and as
% follows:
%  
% $F_{mts} = H_{ts}(h_s + h_{os} + h_w)$
%  
% Only missing parameter is H of stator tooth and its value will be taken

%%
% Only missing dimension for stator side is its back core and this value
% may be calculated with the formula below (15.32):
%  
% $h_{cs} = \frac{D_{out} - (D_{is} + 2(h_s + h_{os} + h_w))}{2}$
h_cs = (Dout -(Dis+2*(hs + h_os + h_w)))/2;

%% Stator Resistance

%% 
% For stator phase resistance formula (15.63) will be used.
%  
% $R_s = \rho_{Co}\frac{l_c N_{ph}}{A_{co}a_1}$
%  
% Here coil length includes the active part 2L and the end connection part
% 2lend
%  
% $l_c = 2(L + l_{end})$
%  
% End connection length depends on the coil span, number of poles, shape of
% coils and number of layers in the winding. For its calculation formula
% (15.65) will be used.
%  
% $l_{end} = 2y - 0.02$
%  
% Here, y is the coil span and can be calculated as
%  
% $y = \beta \tau$

% In coil span formula, beta is chording factor and it is already selected
% as 5/6.

%%
% Another consideration for stator resistance is the copper resistivity. At
% room temperature its value is $1.78 10^{-8} \Omega m$ and at 115 degree
% it increases 37%. Because we don't know the rated temperature yet and

% Now we may calculate the temperature difference between conductors and
% slow wall:
delta_co = P_co/(cond_coef*A_ls);
fprintf('This temperature change is %1.2f degree.',delta_co)
%%
% Supposing the ambient temperature as 30 degree, now we may calculate the
% winding temperature:
delta_frame = P_loss_total/(conv_coef*A_frame);
fprintf('Winding temperature change is %2.2f degree.',delta_frame)
%%
fprintf('In this case maximum temperature is %2.2f degree.',delta_frame+delta_co+30)
%%
% This value is acceptable since design is made for 80 degree maximum.

%% Syre Design and Simulations

%%
% After stator design and other calculations are completed using induction
% motor design guide, this stator is combined with a synchronous reluctance 
% rotor, using Syre tool. Thanks to following three Master and Phd thessis 
% from Sweden, lots of useful information are gathered:
%  
% * Design of a Permanent-Magnet Assisted Synchronous Reluctance Machine 
% for a Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle
% * Synchronous Reluctance Machine (SynRM) in Variable Speed Drives (VSD) 
% Applications 
% * Synchronous Reluctance Machine(SynRM) Design 
%  
% One of the suggestions is for deciding number of flux barriers. It is
% indicated that increasing flux numbers increases average torque. But
% after more than four or five of them, increase is saturated. So three and
% four selections are tried and four flux barriers are selected as final
% decision. Flux barrier widths are generated by Syre as per-unit and
% because it looks good and close to the all reference figures, Syre's
% values are kept; 4mm!
%  
% Other suggestion is about rotor's production method. Here are the two
% possible options and their comprasion:
%  
% <<rotor_production.PNG>>
%  
% At this point, the problem about Syre tool is; after some size, it starts
% to create seperation in between flux barriers. So rotor behaves like it
% is transversely laminated. It is possible to understand it from machine's
% FEMM simulation results:
%  
% <<orta_acik.PNG>>
%  
% For this design its rated torque is simulated as 222 Nm:
%  
% <<orta_acik_1.PNG>>
%  
% After a few tries, it is found out that if Syre's designed machine is
% saved and opened usign FEMM manually, it is possible to change it. So
% here, transversely laminated design is converted into axially laminated
% one to have better performance as it is promised.
%  
% <<orta_kapali_femm.PNG>>
%  
% Once this design is saved over the Syre's design and simulation is
% re-run. This time flux path was different!
%  
% <<orta_kapali.PNG>>
%  
% Performance is also better as it is promised and it is 237 Nm now.
%  
% <<orta_kapali_1.PNG>>
%  
% Since still it isn't sufficient enough to obtain desired torque, another
% suggestion is followed and design is converted from trapezoid flux
% barrier shape to circular shape.
%  
% <<yuv_acik.PNG>>
%  
% First design, again was transversely laminated but nevertheless it
% simulated, aand bingoo! Resulting torque was 252 Nm.
%  
% <<yuv_acik_1.PNG>>
%  
% So here, it is possible to say that combining ease of production and
% better performance is possible with transversely-circullar lamination.
% Using same trick, design is converted into axially lamination and results
% are compared;
%  
% <<yuv_kapali_1.PNG>>
%  
% This time torque is increased to 263 Nm. Since this value is good enough
% for BMW i3 application another area; power factor is considered as
% Achilles heel. Until this point, all of the changes let power factor to
% increase but all of these values were below the desired level. So another
% suggestion is considered and permanent magnets are placed inside flux
% barriers. Since it wasn't possible to decide their lengths individually,
% 1/3 rate is accepted. 
% 
% http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/magperm.html
%  
% In Syre's user guide, it is said that for permanent magnet placing
% purpose it is needed to enter magnet's remanence flux density value. For
% NdFeB magnet this value is 1.2 T but because not all of the barrier isn't
% replaced with magnet, remanence value is entered as 0.4 T.
%  
% <<magnet.PNG>>
%  
% With permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motor torque is
% found as 346 Nm from simulation and this time power factor was also much
% more better. With this results, it is possible to say that having an even
% smaller motor is possible or better efficiency might be obtained from
% same sized motor. Since Nd and B are expensive elements, cheaper magnets
% with less remanence might be used to decrease the cost.
